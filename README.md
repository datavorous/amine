## Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **GUI**: FlaskWebGUI
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Additional Libraries**: pyautogui, keyboard, pygetwindow, winsound

## Insights

1. **Multithreading**: The application uses Python's threading module to run the Pomodoro timer and mouse boundary enforcement concurrently with the main Flask application.

2. **Low-Level Input Blocking**: Utilizes the `keyboard` library to block specific key combinations at a system level, providing robust protection against common distraction patterns.

3. **Window Management**: Employs `pygetwindow` to manipulate application windows, ensuring the focus stays on the target website.

4. **Custom GUI with Flask**: Leverages FlaskWebGUI to create a desktop application experience using web technologies, allowing for a responsive and easily customizable interface.

5. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid UI development and consistent styling across the application.

   - Number of sessions
   - Focus duration (in minutes)
   - Break duration (in minutes)
   - Website URL for focusing
